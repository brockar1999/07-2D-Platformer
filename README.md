2D Platformer for MSCH-C220 by Allie Brock

A platformer game involving slimes and an icy landscape. Extra features include a moving camera, an animated sprite, & bouncing on enemy heads.

Could not figure out save/load functionality, nor the reporting of score or how to have enemies kill player upon impact. I utilized many resources, including the tutorials you provided. Game art is largely from Kenney.
